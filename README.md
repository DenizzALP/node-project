📚 Excel Upload Feature
Users with the appropriate permissions (e.g., category_import) can upload an Excel file (.xlsx). The server parses the file using the xlsx library and saves the data into MongoDB collections. This feature enables fast bulk imports and simplifies data entry.



🛡️ Security
All endpoints are protected with JWT tokens

Admin-only access is enforced for sensitive routes

Input is validated and sanitized

npm audit used to detect and fix known vulnerabilities


📝 Logging
Request logs and error logs are handled using morgan (or winston)

Logs are stored in logs/ folder (optional setup)
